# Amateur enthusiast vs. Bureau of Meteorology

## A Comparison of Rainfall Data


### Overview

KM, a resident of Sunbury, Victoria, has been recording the amount of
rainfall collected in his backyard rain gauge with enthusiastic precision for
more than a decade. 

This investigation is to determine if there is any difference between 
KMâ€™s records and the data available for the same area from the Bureau of Meteorology.
